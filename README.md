# Configuring 🛠

After running `yarn configure`, you will be prompted by a set of questions. Well, this section provides documentation to those stuff 🙂.

- Name: Provide your name or the Title you would like to see
- Description: Simply describe yourself 😃!
- ShadowType: this is optional, but your avatar would look great if you apply some shadow to it. Use `soft-shadow` to apply a soft one. You can also use `violet-gradient`, `green-gradient`, `reflection` -> slightly reflects your avatar to the bottom.
- Animated Shadow: animate the shadow of your avatar. provide **y** for yes, **n** for no. The default value is yes.

## Questions 🤔

- How to setup your custom avatar Instead of the default one?
  The answer is simple, the component fetches the image from [/src/assets/png/avatar.png](https://github.com/haneenmahd/linked/blob/master/src/assets/png/avatar.png). You can move your image file into that specific path.
